# MAGE2D ðŸš§

MAGE2D is a simple 2D game engine built for educational purposes. It leverages Direct3D for rendering and provides a basic framework for creating 2D games.

## Features

- **Window Management**: Create and manage game windows.
- **Graphics**: Initialize and use Direct3D for rendering.
- **Game Loop**: A real-time loop to handle game updates and rendering.
- **Input Handling**: Basic keyboard and mouse input handling.
- **Timer: High-resolution timer for precise time measurements and controlling the frame update rate (FPS).

## Project Structure

- **Engine.h / Engine.cpp**: Core of the engine, handles the game loop and initialization.
- **Game.h / Game.cpp**: Abstract base class for the game, which must be inherited to create a specific game.
- **Graphics.h / Graphics.cpp**: Manages Direct3D initialization and rendering.
- **Window.h / Window.cpp**: Manages window creation and input handling.
- **Timer.h / Timer.cpp: Provides high-resolution timing functionalities and controls the frame update rate (FPS).
- **Types.h**: Defines specific types used throughout the engine.
